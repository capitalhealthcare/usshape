                <p>
                  Mr Syed Javaid Anwar is a role model for not only our children
                  as they are planning their careers, but for each of us as we
                  think about how we can give back to our community and how to
                  use our unique role as citizen ambassadors to deepen the
                  US-Pakistan relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Syed Javaid Anwar is a proud Texan, but he will always be the
                  son of Tahira Khatoon from Karachi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Honorable Tahira Khatoon raised Syed Anwar as a single mother.
                  Even without much to share, she was committed to giving back
                  to the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are announcing an innovative educational program named in
                  her memory. The values she instilled in our honored guest are
                  the values we will look for in the students selected by this
                  program. This program will help bringing engineers, IT experts
                  to come to usa for higher studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is an educational program to help disadvantaged
                  Pakistanis pursue their dream for higher studies in usa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mr Anwar knows what an education in America can do – not just
                  for one student, but for their community back home and their
                  community here in the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is a truly a ripple effect. Just like one drop of oil
                  spreading far across the surface of water. Our help for
                  underprivileged will alleviate poverty and welcome all
                  Pakistanis regardless of their religious background. The loan
                  program is also an admirable step in this regard.
                </p>
